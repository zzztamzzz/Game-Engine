# 4D Game Engine Documentation

## Overview
This is a custom C++ game engine designed to support 2D, 3D, and 4D game development with time manipulation capabilities. The engine features a component-based architecture, advanced physics system, and robust mathematical foundation for handling four-dimensional space.

This is also my first attempt at building a project with some level of Vibe Coding with the help of Cursor.
